npSUFER is a browser extension that
overlays a grid on any web page.
It lets you quickly open links.

The overlayed grid is controlled by the number pad on your keyboard.
You make it visible whenever you want to visit a link.
The grid disappears after it opens the link.
By using npSURFER, you don't have to use the mouse to click links.
